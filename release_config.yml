community-project-name: Exasol Virtual Schema
community-project-description: |
  The Virtual Schema provides an abstraction layer that makes an external database accessible from an Exasol database through regular SQL commands.
  The contents of the external database are mapped to virtual tables which look like, and can be queried as, any regular Exasol table.

  The Exasol Virtual Schema uses Exasol database as a datasource. The datasource can be the same node/cluster where the virtual schema is created or it can also external.
  The Exasol Virtual Schema provides three different connection types (JDBC, EXA and local). Please, check the [user guide](https://github.com/exasol/exasol-virtual-schema/blob/main/doc/dialects/exasol.md) for more datails
